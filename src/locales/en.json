This project promises to revolutionize the cultural scene by offering a place where the unexpected becomes the norm. Conceived as a multi-dimensional space — acoustic concert hall, mini-museum full of rare pieces, café-bar in the heart of a florist and modular event space — the House of Bozo invites exploration of new artistic horizons.",
